    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tasty favorite for the non-meat lovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1Â½ pounds Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound capellini pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 leaves basil, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water.</li>
        <li>Score a shallow "x" in the bottom of the tomatoes. Add tomatoes to the boiling water and cook uncovered until skin starts to peel off, about 1 minute. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Peel tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Transfer peeled tomatoes to a food mill, and process until smooth.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain, saving 1/4 cup of the pasta water for the sauce.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add garlic and salt and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pureed tomatoes and as much pasta water as desired. Simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide pasta amongst 4 serving bowls. Top with tomato sauce and sprinkle with fresh basil. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
